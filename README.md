# Personal Budget Application
One of my pet projects was to create a personal budget application. At the time I was using spreadsheets, something I'm not a fan of, and thought creating my own application would be a nice challenge.
## Key Features
- Separate Views for Income and Expenses
- Entry Categorization
- Printable Report
## Tech Used
- AngularJS
## Current Status
- On the backburner
- No save feature so you have to manually enter everything, every time
## Roadmap
I eventually want to rebuild this application using an actual database and cloud hosting
