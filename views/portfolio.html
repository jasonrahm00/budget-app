  <p>I began my professional career as a web-content writer. It was as a writer that I gained my first exposure to HTML, CSS and web-development processes. In an effort to improve my skillset and marketability to employers, I decided to learn front-end web development; it helps that I find it very engaging and empowering.</p>
