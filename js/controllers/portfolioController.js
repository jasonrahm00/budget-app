          "explanation": "The Institutional arm of Janus wanted some of their pages completely redesigned and a few new funds added. Unfortunately, the Institutional site is on an older technology stack and CMS and is difficult to manage; new designs are next to impossible without a significant time commitment from the developer team. So, the digital marketing manager looked to me to solve this problem. Using a lot of jQuery and cowboy-style coding (but very minimal inline styling), I was able to provide the pages the Institutional business was looking for while maintaining the look and feel of the actual Institutional site. The above linked page along with the 'Investment Insights', 'Defined Contribution' and 'About Us' pages in the main navigation bar utilize my custom styles while the other buttons take you to the standard Institutional site."

          "explanation": "I built this page for Janus Capital Group at the beginning of 2015. I was given an Axure file design and was able to lay the page out and implement all of the functionality they desired. Since I did not have access to upload custom styles for the bubbles, I had to use jQuery and a little in-line styling to achieve the colors and hover functionality. The small bubbles at the bottom of the page also feature jQuery tooltips that open on hover. The jQuery UI widgets were available within the Janus CMS, so I could build those pieces without in-line styling."

          "explanation": "One of the tasks I was given while Janus re-platformed their Retail website was to add jQuery togglers to several articles. The widget was available within the CMS, so I was able to customize the properties to achieve the desired functionality. Due to the nature of the Ingeniux Content Management System, I had to create several common components (<div> tags) in the system so they can be reused wherever togglers are required."

          "explanation": "Another project I took on at Janus was to create common components and an easy method to assign links to the right rail zone on all article pages. I achieved this using taxonomy and special component schemas called 'Annotations'. Rather than hard-coding right-rail links on the necessary pages, there is now a repository of links with associated taxonomy categories from which to choose. Given the opportunity, there are further improvements I would make to the right-rail creation and link assignment method."

I was able to repurpose the code for one of those tables to create this page. Since Janus content has an expiration date, whenver one of the documents on this table expires, the row will disappear until the content is refreshed and the expiration date changed."

Businesses use blogs to provide relevant information about the company and industry, and since blogs are less formal than articles, businesses can show their personality in the posts. Ideally, each blog post is no longer than 600 words; shorter is better, and each post should be about a single topic or tell a short story. I say “ideally” and “should” because a lot of individuals use blogs as journals and write paragraph upon paragraph. It is still important to follow proper web-writing techniques when writing blogs.",
